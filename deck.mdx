### A quick history lesson

### The Dark Ages
<img style={{ width: '30%' }} src={ruler} />

### Photoshop ruled the world
<Notes>
  Bloated files, an expensive license, and in a program made to do everything!

  I remember, not long ago It was a big deal to know photoshop as a developer, as that was the only way you could know how to extract the values you needed.

<Notes>
  Sketch used to be the new kid on the block! Many designers around me were hesitant to switch over

  Sketch made things better, finally a tool for just UIs! but despite coming out a full 10 years ago no innovation has occured in the last few years.

  Zeplin capatilized on this, so did invision (our current stack)

  Sketch is now the expensive license ( not normally given to devs so we can't participate upstream)

  They have spoken about adding in some more modern features, like live, and developer handoff in 2020

  Sketch is not bad, but they haven't pushing the ball forward fast enough IMO.

  <h1>Figma!</h1>
</div>
<Notes>
  Offers a very similar set of tools to Sketch (with some key diffences that Claire can speak to better)

  Why change now?

<img style={{ width: '30%' }} src={collab} />
<Notes>
  Figma enables participation from all members in the early stages of a project.

  Is a slightly differnt mental model, but offers basic prototyping functionality and code sample export (similar to zeplin)
  figma handoff

  Robust plugin ecosystem as well

### Framer X
<span style={{fontSize:"1em"}}>Well this is different</span>
<Notes>
  Framer X feels un-natural at first look. Code and design in the same tool!?!?!

  Essentially can do everything that Sketch can. Also allows copying and pasting from Sketch (i kid you not, Ctrl-C then Ctrl-V)

  React based, Somewhat high learning curve, but for products with UI kits or shared components that evolve over time

  Components in Framer X are real. Real real.

  Animations and Interactions are powered by a powerful animmation library that ports directly to web for achieving more boundary pushing animations

  Power to create and organize robust design systems by pulling real, tested components in from production react components, or create your own from design or code.

  Compose those components with drag and drop.

  Web Client coming!

  But more important than tools, is  <strong>process.</strong>

  Lets share more often, and make <strong>collaborative design happen!</strong>
