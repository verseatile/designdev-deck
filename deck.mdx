### A quick history lesson

---

### The Dark Ages
<img style={{ width: '30%' }} src={ruler} />

---

### Photoshop ruled the world
<Notes>
  Bloated files, an expensive license, and in a program made to do everything!

  I remember, not long ago It was a big deal to know photoshop as a developer, as that was the only way you could know how to extract the values you needed.

<div style={{
  height: '100%',
  display: 'flex',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  flexDirection: 'column'
}}>
  <img style={{ width: '30%' }} src={sketch} />
</div>

### Sketchy Future?
<Notes>
  Sketch made things better, finally a tool for just UIs! but despite coming out a full 10 years ago no innovation has occured in the last few years.

  Zeplin capatilized on this, so did invision (our current stack)

  Sketch is now the expensive license ( not normally given to devs so we can't participate upstream)
