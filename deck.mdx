### A quick history lesson

---

### The Dark Ages
<img style={{ width: '30%' }} src={ruler} />

---

### Photoshop ruled the world
<Notes>
  Bloated files, an expensive license, and in a program made to do everything!

  I remember, not long ago It was a big deal to know photoshop as a developer, as that was the only way you could know how to extract the values you needed.
</Notes>

<div style={{
  height: '100%',
  display: 'flex',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  flexDirection: 'column'
}}>
  <img style={{ width: '30%' }} src={sketch} />
</div>

### Sketchy Future?
<Notes>
  Sketch made things better, finally a tool for just UIs! but despite coming out a full 10 years ago no innovation has occured in the last few years.

  Zeplin capatilized on this, so did invision (our current stack)

  Sketch is now the expensive license ( not normally given to devs so we can't participate upstream)

### Possible Approaches

```jsx
<CodeSnippet />
```

---

React Sketch-app

---

<p style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '0 80px' }}>Generate styles definitions from csv/excel files and pull into both code and design</p>

---

### Framer X

---

<p style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '0 80px' }}>
  Essentially can do everything that Sketch can. Also allows copying and pasting from Sketch
<br />
<br />
(i kid you not, Ctrl-C then Ctrl-V)
</p>

---

Extensive animation capability

---

Power to create and organize robust design systems.

---

<p style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '0 80px' }}>
  But more important than tools, is process.

  Lets share more often, and make it happen!
