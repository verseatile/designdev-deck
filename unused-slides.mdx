### Photoshop ruled the world
<Notes>
  Bloated files, an expensive license, and in a program made to do everything!

  I remember, not long ago It was a big deal to know photoshop as a developer, as that was the only way you could know how to extract the values you needed.

### Sketchy Future?
<Notes>
  Sketch used to be the new kid on the block! I remember many  designers in my
  Sketch made things better, finally a tool for just UIs! but despite coming out a full 10 years ago no innovation has occured in the last few years.

  Zeplin capatilized on this, so did invision (our current stack)

  Sketch is now the expensive license ( not normally given to devs so we can't participate upstream)

  Roadmap of sketch

### Possible Approaches
# Figma!
<Notes>
  Why change now?

  Figma enables participation in the early stages of a project.

  Is a slightly differnt mental model, but offers basic prototyping functionality and code sample export (similar to zeplin)
  figma handoff

# Framer X
<span style={{fontSize:"1em"}}>Well this is different</span>

<Notes>
  Framer X feels un-natural at first look. Code and design in the same tool!?!?!

  React based, Somewhat high learning curve, but for products with UI kits or shared components that evolve over time

  Components in Framer X are real. Real real.

  Animations and Interactions are powered by a powerful animmation library that ports directly to web for achieving more boundary pushing animations

  Pull things in from production react components, or create your own from design or code.

  Compose those components with drag and drop.

  Create custom UI for every component, and reuse across multiple projects.

  Web Client coming!
